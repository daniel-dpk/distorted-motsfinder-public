    "# Summary: \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook Tutorial demonstrating how to implement a new analytical metric in MOTSFinder. There are numerous other ways to put a new metric into MOTSFinder, but the approach outlined below is the simplest option to get started. \n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate by showing the steps in implementing the Kerr metric in Cartesian Kerr-Schild form. Before doing so, we comment on two basic potential usages of MOTSFinder and their respective necessary quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage 1: \n",
    "\n",
    "For calculating quantities on the slice (e.g. spectrum for the stability operator of [3], etc.), you will need:\n",
    "- an analytic expression for the 3-metric and extrinsic curvature of the slice/hypersurface\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage 2: \n",
    "\n",
    "For time evolution purposes, or any other purpose involving multiple slices/hypersurfaces, you will need:\n",
    "- an analytic expression for the 3-metric, lapse, shift, and extrinsic curvature of the slice/hypersurface\n",
    "- (Optional) analytic expressions for the derivatives (any nonzero order) of the shift, lapse, and extrinsic curvature of the slice/hypersurface\n",
    "    \n",
    "Clearly, Usage 1 is included in Usage 2, and so in the following tutorial, we assume your purpose is Usage 2 (i.e. we implement analytic expressions for the 3-metric, lapse, shift, and extrinsic curvature).\n",
    "\n",
    "# <span style=\"color:red\">Important:</span>\n",
    "- You should always perform convergence tests with different resolutions for the finite difference method in taking derivatives and pseudo-spectral method for curves. This will help you estimate the accuracy of your numerical results. To avoid redundancy, convergence tests are not included below.\n",
    "    - The parameter ```res``` denotes the inverse finite difference step size for taking derivatives. Change this to vary the resolution for the finite difference method.\n",
    "    - The parameter ```num``` denotes the number of basis functions to use when expanding a function in a Fourier-like basis (i.e. into Sines, Cosines, Chebyshev polynomials, etc.). Change this to vary the resolution of the pseudo-spectral method. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Other Notes:\n",
    "- MOTSFinder assumes axisymmetry; each 2D plot drawn is the $xz$ plane\n",
    "- Points are in Cartesian $(x,y,z)$ coordinates; thus you cannot implement an analytical metric with angular coordinates in MOTSFinder\n",
    "- Triple quotes ```\"\"\"...\"\"\"``` in the code are for Doxygen to generate documentation. Adding documentation (including references to where formulas come from) is strongly recommended for clarity and ease of use for yourself and others.\n",
    "- We take $G = c = \\hbar = 1$ and use Latin indices, e.g. $i,j,k$, to denote spacelike coordinates ($x,y,z$) and Greek indices, e.g. $\\alpha,\\beta,\\mu,\\nu$, to denote spacetime coordinates ($t,x,y,z$).\n",
